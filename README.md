30MMF Website: Cultural Exchange

This website introduces a film named 'Cultural Exchange,' which is a 90-seconds clip created by Daeun and Dania for the course 'Communications Lab.' The website gives basic summary of the film and lets the viewer to watch it.

In order to provide consistency to the website and film, I used a 'juxtaposition' layout when introducing the summary. I used CSS Bootstrap to create it. 

I could successfully create the concept of juxtaposition that I'd planned by searching for resources and learning new codes.
